# Tenor Joachim Bäckström Frontend

Degree project for my Front End education course at Medieinstitutet.

This is the frontend repo for a website presenting Tenor Joachim Bäckström's resume and future. Joachim has been working as a tenor for several years but has never had his own website. The goal with this project is that it hopefully widens his audience and gives them a more personal side of him.
